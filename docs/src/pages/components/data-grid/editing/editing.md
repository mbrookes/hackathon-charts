# Data Grid - Editing

<p class="description">The data grid has built-in edit capabilities that you can customize to your needs.</p>

## Cell editing

Cell editing allows editing the value of one cell at a time.
Set the `editable` property in the `GridColDef` object to `true` to allow editing cells of this column.

```tsx
<DataGrid columns={[{ field: 'name', editable: true }]} />
```

{{"demo": "pages/components/data-grid/editing/BasicEditingGrid.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

### Start editing

If a cell is editable and has focus, any of the following interactions will start the edit mode:

- A <kbd class="key">Enter</kbd> keydown
- A <kbd class="key">Backspace</kbd> or <kbd class="key">Delete</kbd> keydown. It will also delete the value and stops the edit mode instantly.
- A keydown of any printable key, for instance `a`, `E`, `0`, or `$`
- A double click on the cell
- A call to `apiRef.current.setCellMode(id, field, 'edit')`.
  ```tsx
  /**
    * Set the cellMode of a cell.
    * @param GridRowId
    * @param string
    * @param 'edit' | 'view'
    */
  setCellMode: (id: GridRowId, field: string, mode: GridCellMode) => void;
  ```

### Stop editing

If a cell is in edit mode and has focus, any of the following interactions will stop the edit mode:

- A <kbd class="key">Escape</kbd> keydown. It will also roll back changes done in the value of the cell.
- A <kbd class="key">Tab</kbd> keydown. It will also save and goes to the next cell on the same row.
- A <kbd class="key">Enter</kbd> keydown. It will also save and goes to the next cell on the same column.
- A mousedown outside the cell
- A call to `apiRef.current.setCellMode(id, field, 'view')`.

### Control cell editability

In addition to the `editable` flag on columns, control which cell is editable using the `isCellEditable` prop.

In this demo, only the rows with an even `Age` value are editable.
The editable cells have a green background for better visibility.

{{"demo": "pages/components/data-grid/editing/IsCellEditableGrid.js", "bg": "inline"}}

### Controlled editing

The `editRowsModel` prop lets you control the editing state.
You can handle the `onEditRowsModelChange` callback to control the `GridEditRowsModel` state.

{{"demo": "pages/components/data-grid/editing/CellEditControlGrid.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

### Column with valueGetter

You can control the committed value when the edit move stops with the `onCellEditCommit` prop.
This is especially interesting when using the `valueGetter` on the column definition.

{{"demo": "pages/components/data-grid/editing/ValueGetterGrid.js", "bg": "inline"}}

### Client-side validation

To validate the value in the cells, use `onEditRowsModelChange` to set the `error` attribute of the respective field when the value is invalid.
If this attribute is true, the value will never be committed.
This prop is invoked when a change is triggered by the edit cell component.

Alternatively, you can use the `GridEditRowsModel` state mentioned in the [Controlled editing](#controlled-editing) section.

{{"demo": "pages/components/data-grid/editing/ValidateRowModelControlGrid.js", "bg": "inline"}}

### Server-side validation

Server-side validation works like client-side [validation](#client-side-validation).

- Use `onEditCellPropsChange` to set the `error` attribute to true of the respective field which will be validated.
- Validate the value in the server.
- Once the server responds, set the `error` attribute to false if it is valid. This allows to commit it.

**Note:** To prevent the default client-side behavior, set `event.defaultMuiPrevented` to `true`.

This demo shows how you can validate a username asynchronously and prevent the user from committing the value while validating.
It's using `DataGridPro` but the same approach can be used with `DataGrid`.

{{"demo": "pages/components/data-grid/editing/ValidateServerNameGrid.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

### Custom edit component

To customize the edit component of a column, use the `renderEditCell` attribute available in the `GridColDef`.

The demo lets you edit the ratings by double-clicking the cell.

{{"demo": "pages/components/data-grid/editing/RenderRatingEditCellGrid.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

### Edit using external button [<span class="pro"></span>](https://material-ui.com/store/items/material-ui-pro/)

You can override the default [start editing](#start-editing) triggers using the [`event.defaultMuiPrevented`](/components/data-grid/events#disabling-the-default-behavior) on the synthetic React events.

{{"demo": "pages/components/data-grid/editing/StartEditButtonGrid.js", "bg": "inline", "disableAd": true}}

### Events [<span class="pro"></span>](https://material-ui.com/store/items/material-ui-pro/)

The editing feature leverages the event capability of the grid and the apiRef.
The following events can be imported and used to customize the edition:

- `cellEditStart`: emitted when the cell turns to edit mode.
- `cellEditStop`: emitted when the cell turns back to view mode.
- `cellEditCommit`: emitted when the new value is committed.
- `editCellPropsChange`: emitted when the props passed to the edit cell component are changed.

Catching events can be used to add a callback after an event while ignoring its triggers.

The demo shows how to catch the start & end edit events to log which cell is editing in an info message:

{{"demo": "pages/components/data-grid/editing/CatchEditingEventsGrid.js", "bg": "inline", "disableAd": true}}

## Row editing

Row editing allows to edit all the cells of a row at once.
It is based on the [cell editing](/components/data-grid/editing/#cell-editing), thus most of the features are also supported.
To enable it, change the edit mode to `"row"` using the `editMode` prop, then set to `true` the `editable` property in the `GridColDef` object of those columns that should be editable.

```tsx
<DataGrid editMode="row" columns={[{ field: 'name', editable: true }]} />
```

{{"demo": "pages/components/data-grid/editing/BasicRowEditingGrid.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

### Start editing

If a cell is editable and has focus, any of the following interactions will start the edit mode of the corresponding row:

- A <kbd class="key">Enter</kbd> keydown
- A double click on the cell
- A call to `apiRef.current.setRowMode(id, 'edit')`.
  ```tsx
  /**
    * Sets the mode of a row.
    * @param {GridRowId} id The id of the row.
    * @param {GridRowMode} mode Can be: `"edit"`, `"view"`.
    */
  setRowMode: (id: GridRowId, mode: GridRowMode) => void;
  ```

### Stop editing

If a row is in edit mode and one of its cells is focused, any of the following interactions will stop the edit mode:

- A <kbd class="key">Escape</kbd> keydown. It will also roll back changes done in the row.
- A <kbd class="key">Enter</kbd> keydown. It will also save and goes to the cell at the next row at the same column.
- A mouse click outside the row
- A call to `apiRef.current.setRowMode(id, 'view')`.

### Controlled editing

The `editRowsModel` prop lets you control the editing state.
You can handle the `onEditRowsModelChange` callback to control the `GridEditRowsModel` state.

{{"demo": "pages/components/data-grid/editing/RowEditControlGrid.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

### Conditional validation

Having all cells of a row in edit mode allows validating a field based on the value of another one.
To accomplish that, set the `onEditRowsModelChange` prop and return a new model with the `error` attribute of the invalid field set to `true`.
Use the other fields available in the model to check if the validation should run or not.
Once at the least one field has the `error` attribute equals to true no new value will be committed.

**Note:** For server-side validation, the same [approach](#server-side-validation) from the cell editing can be used.

The following demo only requires a value for the "Paid at" column if the "Is paid?" column was checked.

{{"demo": "pages/components/data-grid/editing/ConditionalValidationGrid.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

### Control with external buttons [<span class="pro"></span>](https://material-ui.com/store/items/material-ui-pro/)

You can [disable the default behavior](/components/data-grid/events/#disabling-the-default-behavior) of the grid and control the row edit using external buttons.

Here is shown how a full-featured CRUD can be created.

{{"demo": "pages/components/data-grid/editing/FullFeaturedCrudGrid.js", "bg": "inline", "disableAd": true}}

### Events [<span class="pro"></span>](https://material-ui.com/store/items/material-ui-pro/)

The following events can be imported and used to customize the row edition:

- `rowEditStart`: emitted when the row turns to edit mode.
- `rowEditStop`: emitted when the row turns back to view mode.
- `rowEditCommit`: emitted when the new row values are committed.
- `editCellPropsChange`: emitted when the props passed to an edit cell component are changed.

## apiRef [<span class="pro"></span>](https://material-ui.com/store/items/material-ui-pro/)
