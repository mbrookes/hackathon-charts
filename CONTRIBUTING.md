# Contributing to MUI X

## MUI X vs. MUI Core

MUI X is an extension of MUI Core.
The repositories are part of the same codebase.
`mui-org/material-ui-x` imports the code infrastructure from [`mui-org/material-ui`](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui).
You can find the "contributing" guide for the main repository in [mui-org/material-ui/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Most of the content in the MUI "contributing" guide applies to this repository.
There are, however, a few differences:

- The default GitHub branch might be different.
- The local documentation site opens on a different port: 3001 instead of 3000.
